# Portfolio and E-Commerce Projects

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, showcasing my personal and professional projects, including an **E-Commerce Website** and an **Exam-Wise Summarisation Tool**. Each project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, web scraping, and machine learning.

## Projects

### 1. **E-Commerce Website**

This project is a full-stack e-commerce platform that facilitates interactions between buyers and sellers. Sellers can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage product listings, while buyers can browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders. The website uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, with **Java Servlets** handling the backend logic. Data is stored and managed using **JDBC** to communicate with a **MySQL database**.

Key Features:
- CRUD operations for sellers to manage products
- Product browsing, adding to cart, and order placement for buyers
- Backend implemented using Java Servlets and JDBC

### 2. **Exam-Wise Summarisation Tool**

This Python-based web application helps students prepare for exams by providing concise summaries of topics scraped from educational websites like **Javatpoint**. The tool uses **SpaCy** for natural language processing to generate summaries and is deployed using **Flask**. The summarisation process involves web scraping the data and summarising it into easily digestible content for exam preparation.

Key Features:
- Web scraping educational content from sites like Javatpoint
- Text summarisation using **SpaCy** for concise exam-focused summaries
- Deployed using **Flask** for a user-friendly web interface

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java Servlets (E-commerce Project), Flask (Summarisation Tool)
- **Database**: MySQL, JDBC
- **Python Libraries**: SpaCy (Summarisation Tool)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup (if used for scraping)
